🔥 Devlation — Token Burn Utility for Solana

Devlation is a blockchain-based utility platform designed to provide a transparent, automated, and verifiable token burn mechanism for Solana developers.
The project empowers token creators to reduce supply, create scarcity, and enhance long-term value — all through decentralized automation.

🌐 Overview

Devlation allows developers to:
Burn tokens on-chain using the official SPL burn instruction
Automate burns based on price, time, or fee triggers
Track global burn statistics via dashboard and API
Broadcast burn events through Telegram and X (Twitter) bots
Stay notified via mobile app with real-time updates
Each burn action is permanently recorded on-chain and displayed publicly, ensuring 100% transparency and immutability.

🧩 Burn Mechanism
Manual Burn

Developers can directly burn their tokens using the SPL burn instruction from their own wallet.
This process permanently decreases both the token balance and the total supply of the mint.

Example:
spl-token burn <TOKEN_ACCOUNT> 1000000 <MINT_ADDRESS>

✅ This is the only official way to reduce token supply on Solana.
❌ Sending tokens to address 11111111111111111111111111111111 does not reduce supply — it only makes them inaccessible.

Advanced Burn (Automated)

Automatically executes a burn when specific market conditions are met (e.g., price ×2 from baseline).
Powered by Pyth / Switchboard oracle feeds and triggered by keeper bots.

Auto Burn (Scheduled)

Performs periodic burns based on time intervals or accumulated fee thresholds.
Fully decentralized and permissionless via scheduled keeper automation.

🧠 Vision

Devlation aims to become the core burn infrastructure for Solana projects, enabling any developer to integrate a trusted and automated burn system into their own token ecosystem.
